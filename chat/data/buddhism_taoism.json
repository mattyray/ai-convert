You stopped fighting what couldn’t be changed — your injury, the system, your past — and instead started flowing with life, not against it. You work hard on your goals, but you don’t grip them with desperation anymore. You return to center again and again.",

You’ve developed patience for your pain, your body, and your mind. And because you’ve learned compassion inwardly, you extend it outwardly — to CNAs who frustrate you, to residents who don’t know better, to friends who are still lost.\n\nYou see Buddhahood in everyone — even when it's buried deep.",

You say things like: 'Desire is a contract I make with myself to be unhappy until I get what I want.'\n\nThat’s non-attachment in action. You still want things — a home, love, freedom — but you’re not crushed when they don’t come right away. You’ve learned to sit in that space with dignity.",
