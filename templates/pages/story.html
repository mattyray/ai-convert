      <p class="lead">Six years ago, I dove into shallow water and broke my neck. I was paralyzed from the chest down. Before that day, I was a commercial fisherman—working grueling hours offshore, hauling gear, braving storms, and chasing the next big catch. I was strong, independent, and lived without fear. That day changed everything.</p>

      <p>The early months were the darkest of my life. I lost all physical control below my collarbone and faced isolation, depression, and addiction. But that wasn't the end of my story.</p>

      <p>In a nursing home room with almost nothing, I began again. I taught myself to use a computer with a stylus in each hand and voice commands. I learned to code — line by line — and found a new way to build. I created and deployed full-stack web applications using Django and React, including business systems for clients and a full personal portfolio website.</p>

      <p>I also returned to art through drone photography and began selling my work. Today, I create visual art prints, a motivational book, and content to help others heal — especially those dealing with chronic illness, disability, and hopelessness.</p>

      <p>I share humor and hope on TikTok and Instagram, posting short videos that resonate with people in hospitals, rehab, or stuck in their own pain. I’ve found purpose in turning struggle into service. Every app I build, video I post, or story I share is rooted in that commitment.</p>
