      <p>Whether you're a business owner in need of a custom web application or a company looking for a passionate developer, I build software that works in the real world.</p>
      <p>I'm <strong>Matthew Raynor</strong>—a former commercial fisherman turned full-stack web developer after a life-changing spinal cord injury. I taught myself how to code without the use of my hands, learning Django and Python from scratch with a stylus and sheer determination. That same determination drives every project I build today.</p>
      <p>I’ve developed a <strong>full-featured logistics and invoicing system for an art moving company</strong>, complete with client management, calendar-based job scheduling, PDF invoicing, and drag-and-drop UI. I’ve built an <strong>e-commerce store</strong>, a <strong>donation platform</strong> with blog and video integration, and an <strong>AI chatbot</strong> using OpenAI’s API for real-time support.</p>
      <p>For <strong>clients</strong>, I create secure, scalable, and easy-to-use web apps tailored to your workflow. For <strong>employers</strong>, I bring production-level skills in Django, Docker, PostgreSQL, React, and a lived perspective on problem-solving, perseverance, and accessibility. I build with both code and compassion—and I’m ready to add value from day one.</p>
